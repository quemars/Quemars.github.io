Build a simple and friendly app that;
- Displays local time for a chosen city and updates every second
- Allows selecting one city from a dropdown 
- Enhanced Feature (idea): allow adding/removing multiple cities and a dark/light theme
- Advanced Feature (idea): timezone event conversion and world map with clickable cities
- shows the current time for selected cities and updates every second. Basic mode shows a single selected city from a dropdown. Enhanced mode allows multiple saved cities and a dark/light theme. Stretch goals include timezone conversion for events and an interactive world map with clickable cities.
